1.3-beta7 release
=================

We are pleased to announce you the 1.3-beta7 release of ASCIIpOrtal!

This release brings the following changes:

* loads of bugfixes
* a lot of reorganization in the map packs (proper descriptions, sorted by difficulty, etc)
* an **OS X release**, thanks to cynddl!
* Cymon is back to the project for real, to make ASCIIpOrtal even better! :)

However, this is still a beta, so please report bugs as usual (on GitHub's issue tracker at <https://github.com/cymonsgames/ASCIIpOrtal/issues>)


For the next release, we are willing to implemented:

* a basic **window manager** (yeah, you've surely noticed the ugly dialog when selecting a map pack... it's waiting for that window manager)
* a brand new **game engine**. The current one is getting impossible to improve (see the next point ;) ). We are going to do our best not to break existing maps, but we can't promise everything will be the same...
* **moving platforms**, see <http://cymonsgames.com/forum/index.php?topic=1298.0>

Also, getting this new website up and running is on our TODO-list. If you have any idea on how to improve it (most notably, design), feel free to join us on [IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/#asciiportal) ([web-based client](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=asciiportal)), or on the forums, or on Github...
